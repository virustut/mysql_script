------------------------MYSQL Root Password Changed------------------------

--- 1. Stop the MySQL Service
--- First, stop the MySQL server to prepare for starting it in safe mode.

--- on linux : 
	--- sudo systemctl stop mysql

--- on windows : 
	--- net stop mysql

--- 2. Start MySQL in Safe Mode (Skip Grant Tables)

--- Start MySQL without loading the privilege tables, so you can access it without a password.

	--- sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &

--- Note : Alternatively, if mysqld_safe isnâ€™t available, you can try:

	--- sudo mysqld --skip-grant-tables &
--- 3. Connect to MySQL

--- Open a new terminal window and connect to the MySQL server as the root user:

	--- mysql -u root

--- 4. Reset the Root Password

	--- Once connected, change the root password:
		
	/*	USE mysql;
		UPDATE user SET authentication_string = PASSWORD('NewRootPassword') WHERE User = 'root';
		FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

		Note : Replace 'NewRootPassword' with your new password.
	*/

--- 5. Stop and Restart MySQL Normally  ---> Exit the MySQL shell: EXIT

--- Stop the MySQL server running in safe mode:

	--- sudo systemctl stop mysql

--- Start MySQL normally:

	--- sudo systemctl start mysql


--- 6. Test the New Root Password

	--- mysql -u root -p
