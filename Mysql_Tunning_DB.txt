1. Understand Your Workload
Before making any changes, itâ€™s important to understand your application's workload and requirements. This includes the number of concurrent users, types of queries, data size, and expected growth.

2. MySQL Configuration File (my.cnf)
Location:

a) Linux/Unix: /etc/mysql/my.cnf, /etc/my.cnf, or /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf 

b) Windows: C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini

Important Parameters to Tune:


InnoDB Buffer Pool Size:

 a) Determines how much memory is allocated to the InnoDB storage engine.

innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G   # Adjust based on available memory and workload

Key Buffer Size:

b) For MyISAM tables (if used).

key_buffer_size = 256M   # Adjust based on usage of MyISAM tables


Query Cache:
 c) Enables caching of SELECT query results.

query_cache_type = 1
query_cache_size = 64M   # Adjust based on workload

Connection Settings:
 d) max_connections = 200   # Adjust based on workload

Log Settings:
 e) Enable slow query logging for performance analysis 

slow_query_log = 1
slow_query_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log   # Adjust path as needed
long_query_time = 2   # Time in seconds; log queries taking longer than this
 

InnoDB Settings:
  f) InnoDB is the default storage engine for MySQL 5.5 and higher.

innodb_file_per_table = 1
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2
innodb_log_file_size = 256M   # Adjust based on workload


Temporary Tables:
 g) Configure settings for handling temporary tables.

tmp_table_size = 64M
max_heap_table_size = 64M
