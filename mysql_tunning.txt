----OPTIMIZE TABLE

Purpose: Physically reorganizes table data and indexes to improve storage efficiency and query performance.

Usage: Recommended when a table has undergone significant deletions (which leave gaps in data pages) or when there is a noticeable performance degradation.

Effect: Rebuilds the table's data and index pages, reclaiming wasted space and improving data locality for faster access.

OPTIMIZE TABLE your_table_name;




----- ANALYZE TABLE

Purpose: Updates index statistics to improve query performance by providing the optimizer with accurate information about the data distribution.

Usage: Typically used after significant changes to data (inserts, updates, deletes) or to tables that experience high data turnover.


ANALYZE TABLE table_name;
