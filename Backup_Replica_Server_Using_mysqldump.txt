1. Stop the replica from processing requests. You can stop replication completely on the replica using mysqladmin:

$> mysqladmin stop-slave

2. Alternatively, you can stop only the replication SQL thread to pause event execution:

$> mysql -e 'STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD;'
Or from MySQL 8.0.22:
$> mysql -e 'STOP REPLICA SQL_THREAD;'


3. Run mysqldump to dump your databases. You may either dump all databases or select databases to be dumped. For example, to dump all databases:

$> mysqldump --all-databases > fulldb.dump

4. Once the dump has completed, start replication again:

$> mysqladmin start-slave


Scenario 1: Backup with a Read-Only Replica

mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
mysql> SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;

mysql> SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF;
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
