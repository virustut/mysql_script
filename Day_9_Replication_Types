mysql> select @@gtid_mode;

mysql> select @@enforce_gtid_consistency;

mysql> system clear;

Note : if above is on no need to change in configuration file or if off
	on it and restart mysql server

now enable on other server's Slave1 and Slave2 and restart mysql server

take a dump or .sql file and import using below command
mysql <employee.sql

Enable the binary log on master

create a mysql replication user on master
create user 'slave_user'@'%' identified with mysql_native_password by 'Not_so_secure1!';

grant replication slave on *.* to 'slave_user'@'%';

stop the slave server mysql 

remove mysql directory

and take a master server backup of entire database 
restore on slave server

and set the GTID 
mysql> SET GLOBAL gtid_purged="02993437-de64-43db-089927b81194:1-181;

change master to === change replication source to
master_host ='',
master_port ='',
master_user ='',
master_password='',
master_auto_position=1;


Enable the binary log 


MySQL Replication Topology

a) master-master replication
b) multi-source replication
c) chain replication
d) single master multi slave(replica) replicaton
e) slave/replica side replication filtering
f) relay log/binary log vs Relay log event storage
g) mixed mode replication 

===Master == Master ==Replication

Add this line in  mysqld in master
auto_increment_increment = 2
auto_increment_offset    = 1

Add this line in  mysqld in slave
auto_increment_increment = 2
auto_increment_offset    = 2

Restar the services 

create replicatio user in master and slave server user 
grant replication slave , replication client on *.* to replica@'%';


master  
show binary logs;

flush binary logs; # this will generate new binary log

slave
flush binary logs;

master
show master status;

copy the binary_log.00002 and position

slave
change replication source to 
source_host='master_ip',
source_user='master_user',
source_password='admin@123',
source_log_file ='binary_log.0002',
source_log_pos =157;

start replica;
show replica status\G;

Note : The above one is done from master to slave

Now we need to configure slave to master

show master status\G;

note the binary log postion and file name 

master
change replication source to 
source_host='slave_ip',
source_user='master_user',
source_password='admin@123',
source_log_file ='binary_log.0002',
source_log_pos =156;

start replica ;
show replica status\G;

Note : in master master replication during table creation 
       every table will be created with primary key & auto_increment

Result : in this master master are happen but while inserting data are not insert in
proper valid format it show's like
master: 1,3,5
slave : 6,8,10
all data are showing 1,3,5,6,8,10 
this type of data are not valid location some time the devoloper's are confusing 
where is my no 2 id data ?


#####====Multi Source Replication====#####

Means : multiple master pushing there data into a single slave server
	in this each master binary log to replica relay log of each server is differenec

Three server :
a , b , c
a & b our master and c is our slave

in master.info file is very important file it is contain the info about my user and binlog 
and port positon etc . this is for single master and slave

if we have mutltiple master and single slave then we use the Channel_Name :
and we have remove the master.info file 

Reset slave all; to remove replication 

master1
show binary log status;

master2
show binary log status;



slave
change source replication to
source_host ='',
source_user ='',
source_password ='',
source_log_file='',
source_log_pos=4 
for channel 'ch-1';

during this above is running error has occoured to conveert this file to table type 

go the my.cnf file and add this parameter on slave and restart service

master_info_repository =table
reloay_log_info_repository =table

now run :

change source replication to
source_host ='',
source_user ='',
source_password ='',
source_log_file='',
source_log_pos=4 
for channel 'ch-1';


to fine show clumn master_info_file=mysql.tablename
we can see that in db

mysql > select * from mysq.tablename\G;

Note : in mysql version 8.0 it automatically create in a table that's why no need to add extra column adding in conf file

for master2 
salve(same server)
change source replication to
source_host ='',
source_user ='replica',
source_password ='replica',
source_log_file='binlog.000008',
source_log_pos=4 
for channel 'ch-2';

##Suppose we have to stop only one channel and see only one channel

show slave status for channel 'ch-1'\G;

stop slave for channel 'ch-1'\G;


###impact on relay log 

to read realy log 
mysqlbinlog --v relay-ch1@323.00005





#####====Mysql Chain Replication====#####
 binlog  binlog/relaylog binlog/relaylog
A------>B--------------->C-------->D

Note : in this when master A genrate the binlog and replicate to the server B and this is written in relay log
       now we have to move my data from B to C but in B my log are written in relay log i want to write in to the relay to binlog

Now : get relay to bin log use below parameter to proceed to the next slave 
log_slave_updates or log_replica_updates ( this is implement in slaver b and slave c that is going to d

in mysql 8 or above by default all above points are enable


#####====Mysql Single Master Multi Slave Replica Replication====#####

lower_case_table_names =1
