Method 1: Recover from Backups

If you have a recent backup, you can restore the backup to recover the deleted record. This is the simplest and most reliable method.

1. Identify the backup that contains the data before it was deleted.
2. Restore the backup to a new database or instance to avoid overwriting your current data.
3. Extract the required data from the restored backup.
4. Insert the recovered data back into your production database.


Method 2: Use Binary Logs

If binary logging is enabled, you can use binary logs to recover the deleted records. Binary logs record all changes to the database, allowing you to roll back to a point in time before the deletion occurred.


1. Enable Binary Logging (if not already enabled):
     Add the following lines to your my.cnf or my.ini configuration file and restart MySQL:

[mysqld]
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog_format = ROW


2. Identify the Relevant Binary Log:

Determine which binary log file contains the deletion event using the SHOW BINARY LOGS command.

SHOW BINARY LOGS;


3. Use mysqlbinlog to Examine Binary Logs:

Use the mysqlbinlog utility to examine the contents of the binary logs.

mysqlbinlog --start-datetime="2024-06-12 10:00:00" --stop-datetime="2024-06-12 12:00:00" /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.000001 > binlog.txt

Adjust the date and time to the period when the deletion occurred.

4. Extract the SQL Statements:

Look through the binlog.txt file to find the SQL statements related to the deletion.

5. Reverse the DELETE Statements:

Manually reverse the DELETE statements if possible, or replay the transactions up to the point before the deletion.

Method 3: Use Point-In-Time Recovery

If you have a backup and binary logs, you can perform point-in-time recovery to restore the database to a specific point before the data was deleted.

1. Restore the Most Recent Full Backup:

Restore the most recent full backup of the database.

2. Apply Binary Logs to Roll Forward:

Use the mysqlbinlog utility to apply the binary logs and roll forward to a point just before the deletion.

mysqlbinlog --stop-datetime="2024-06-12 11:59:59" /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.000001 | mysql -u root -p your_database
