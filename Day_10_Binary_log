#----MYSQL Binary logs
1. use for replication
2. perform point in time recovery

When the new binary log file will created 
a) service restart
b) flush_logs
c) max_binlog_size = default is 1GB or we can set max_binlog_size=299M

to read the varibale through the mysql 
mysql > show global variables like '%bin';

Note : We already know in mysql 8 and above the bin-log is by default enable but when we need to disable this binary log we use below command to run in .cnf file
skip_log_bin = 1 # restart the mysql service 

Note : precedenece order
log_bin = binlog
skip_log_bin = 1 

in both above the last one is implemented 

expiry_logs_days = 7 # i.e means after 7 Days my log file will expire 
@@expire_logs_days =0 # i.e never expire in mysql 5.7 version 
but in mysql 8.10 and above default expire 30 Days

mysql > purge binary logs to 'mysqlbinlog.000004'

mysql > purge binary logs before '2025-06-30 15:00';

Binary log formate 
a) row based
b) statement based
c) mixed mode 

mysqlbinlog -v mysqlbinlog.000005 > mysqlbinlog00005.txt
# vi mysqlbinlog000005.txt

## Change binary log location ##
